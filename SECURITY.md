## Reporting security vulnerabilities for Range42 or related Range42 project repositories

Reporting security vulnerabilities is of great importance for us, as Range42 is potentially used in multiple critical environments even when seggregated properly. 

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter to send it directly to [security@range42.net](mailto:security@range42.net) with a copy to [info@circl.lu](mailto:info@circl.lu), if possible encrypted with the following GnuPG keys: **CA57 2205 C002 4E06 BA70  BE89 EAAD CFFC 22BD 4CD5 & 3F4D 8CF6 08F9 4F88 2815  2CB1 69A2 0F50 9BE4 AEE9 **. We usually fix reported and confirmed security vulnerabilities in less than 48 hours, followed by a software release containing the fixes within the following days. 

If you report security vulnerabilities, do not forget to **tell us if and how you want to be acknowledged** and if you already requested CVE(s). Otherwise, we will request the CVE(s) directly.

As we develop under a security first mantra, it is our duty to clearly state which bug could be abused and have a security impact on a Range42 setup. CVE assignment is performed even for minor bugs suspected of having a security impact. This allows every user with a Range42 setup in their environments to understand which bugs could impact their security.

We firmly believe that, even though unfortunately it is often not regarded as common practice in our industry, being as transparent as possible about vulnerabilities, no matter how minor, is of crucial importance. We care about the security of our users and prefer to have a high number of published CVEs rather than sweeping some of them under the rug.
