# range42 Community Health Defaults

This public repository contains the default community health files for the `range42` organization. GitHub will automatically use these files in any public repo under `range42` that does not provide its own version  [oai_citation:0‡GitHub](https://github.com/vondenstein/.github?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1‡GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Why this exists

- **Uniform standards**: Ensures consistent guidelines across all repositories.  
- **Single source of updates**: Modify once here—GitHub applies changes everywhere.  
- **Clean repository history**: Defaults are not included in individual repo clones or Git history  [oai_citation:2‡GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

## Included files

This repository may contain the following community health files:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` – defines community standards.  
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – explains how to contribute.  
- `SECURITY.md` – details vulnerability reporting procedures.  
- `SUPPORT.md` – lists support and communication channels.  
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*` – default issue templates.  
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` – default pull request template.

## How it works

When someone opens an issue or pull request:

1. GitHub checks the repository itself for community health files.
2. If missing, it falls back to this `.github` repo (searching in `.github/`, root, then `docs/`)  [oai_citation:8‡GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:9‡GitHub](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
3. Only local overrides are used; defaults remain hidden from repo history.

---

## Updating defaults

1. Edit or add files in this repository.
2. Commit and push to the default branch.
3. Changes take effect automatically in all public `range42/*` repositories without local overrides.

---

2. Make changes or add files (e.g., new issue templates).
