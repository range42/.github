# Welcome to Range42

**Range42** is a modular cyber range platform designed for real-world readiness.  
We build, deploy, and document offensive, defensive, and hybrid cyber training environments using reproducible, infrastructure-as-code methodologies.

## What We Build

- Proxmox-based cyber ranges with dynamic inventories
- Ansible roles for secure and automated deployments (Wazuh, Kong, Docker, etc.)
- Private APIs for range orchestration and telemetry
- Developer toolkits and JSON transformers for automation pipelines

## Repository Overview

Our repositories are organized into functional groups:
- `range42-ansible_roles-*`: Ansible automation
- `range42-api-*`: Backend orchestration and devkits
- `range42-documentation-*`: Internal & public docs (Obsidian)
- `range42-vulnerable_inventory`: Lab targets and templates
- `range42-emp-mockup`: UI prototypes and demos

Most repositories are private by design. Select components may be released publicly in the future.

## Contributing

This is a collaborative initiative, developed for applied security training, community integration, and internal capability building.  
We use centralized community health files in [range42-community-health](https://github.com/Range42/range42-community-health).
